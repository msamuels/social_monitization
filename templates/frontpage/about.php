    <div class="row">
        <H2>SHARING IS CARING</H2>

        <P>Every day we share things with our friends and family on social media: what we are up to; what's happening
		around us; what made us laugh.
        </P> 

        <P>Occasionally, we will come across a person or a group that is doing something really impactful and innovative
		and we'll share that too. Doing so helps them tremendously because it brings much needed attention to their
		work. That's great! Well at shareitcamp we want to make this as common and easy as sharing a top 10 list. </P>
         
        <H2>SHAREITCAMP MAKES IT SIMPLE...</H2>

        <p>To do this we have developed this platform where the producers of these efforts can present what they are 
		working on and you can help them get exposure by simply sharing this with your friends and family. 
		These efforts range from large undertakings (e.g. a non-profit helping to build schools across Jamaica) 
		to the small (e.g. local entrepreneurs creating a breakthrough app). Regardless of the size, what we 
		are asking you to do remains the same: share it with your network.
        </p> 

        <h2>...AND MAKES IT REWARDING</h2>

        <P>We think that this act of helping to raise awareness of work that is valuable is a special act. You are 
		not only helping by directing attention their way but ultimately you are helping them in their mission 
		of making a positive impact. 
        </P> 

        <P>While the feeling you get is rewarding in itself we want to go a step further and personally (can we say 
		personally as a company?) reward you.  That is why for every 'campaign' you support we will credit 
		you with reward points. These points can be exchanged for some cool things like gift cards. 
        </P> 

        <h2>SHORT VERSION</h2>

        <p>We could have probably summed up all of that by saying shareitcamp is a platform that aims to make sharing 
		even more rewarding.</p>
